Applications of Stacks:
	1) Reversing a word: We can push the letters one-by-one, and then pop it from the stack.
	2) The task of "UNDO": We can keep every text changes in the stack, and to undo, we can pop them.
	3) Parenthesis Matching: When we encounter an opening bracket, push it in the stack. 
	   On encountering a closing bracket, pop the stack.
	4) Backtracking: To access the most recent data element in a series of elements.
	

Applications of Queues:
	1) While downloading multiple files, the order in which we select it, is the order in which it STARTS getting downloaded 
	   (Time taken to download may vary). Hence this task follows First In First Out (FIFO).
	2) Breadth First Search 
	3) Queue is useful in CPU scheduling, Disk scheduling. When multiple processes require CPU at the same time, 
	   various CPU scheduling algorithms are used which are implemented using queue data structure.
	4) In customer servicing systems such as ticket booking or in call centres, queue is followed to decide the priority among customers.
